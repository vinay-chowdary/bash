# bash

practice files ( bash scripts ) : I had learnt bash scripting by creating a separate file to a concept and testing them.
These are stored under practice directory in this repo.

file name suggests the concept for which it is coded.

projects : these are the scripts that i made to put all the concepts that i had learnt, together.
these projects are mostly begining level projects
